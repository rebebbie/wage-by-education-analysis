## 2 A little background about the data (who collected it in what context)

The wage data was collected by Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development
They have been collecting this data since 1997, as part of it's goal to provide neutral 
collective bargaining data, research, and analysis. This is what the Ministry stated about their collection process:

*Beginning January 1997, information is collected on the usual wages or salary of employees at their main job. Respondents are asked to report their wage/salary before taxes and other deductions, and include tips, commissions and bonuses. Weekly and hourly wages/salaries are calculated in conjunction with usual paid work hours per week*


## 3 What is the over all research question that you are trying to answer in your report
Using the wage data from 1997-2019, we are going to investigate the various reasons why wages vary across the population. Our main goal is to discover what factors lead to higher wages and discover trends that may emerge from the data. Our research goals can broken down into three main questions:

1. How much does education level have an impact on someone's wage?
2. What other factors impact wages?
3. How have these factors impacted wages over time?

## 4 Tables 

#### 4.1 Average hourly wage rate and population of each education level
```{r echo=FALSE}
age_edu_count <- df %>% filter(
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS_AND_ALL,
  `Age group` == "15 years and over",
  YEAR == 2019,
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  Wages %in% c("Average hourly wage rate", "Total employees"),
  Geography == "Canada"
)

age_edu_count2 <- age_edu_count %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    c(`Education level`),
    names_from=`Wages`, 
    values_from=`Both Sexes`
  ) %>%
  mutate(`Total employees` = `Total employees` * 1000)

age_edu_count2 %>%
  rename(
    `Number of Employees` = `Total employees`,
    `Average Hourly Wage` = `Average hourly wage rate`
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

This table shows the amount of employees, and their average hourly wage for each education level in 2019. There's also an aggregate of all education levels. The table is sorted in order of least, to most formal education. 

#### 4.2 Average hourly wage rate for each age group by education level

```{r echo=FALSE}
# avg hourly wage rate for each age group by education level
age_edu_count <- df %>% filter(
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS_AND_ALL,
  `Age group` %in% AGE_RANGES,
  YEAR == 2019,
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  Wages == "Average hourly wage rate",
  Geography == "Canada"
)

age_edu_count2 <- age_edu_count %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    c(`Education level`),
    names_from=`Age group`, 
    values_from=`Both Sexes`
  )

age_edu_count2 %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

This table uses the same categorization of education levels, but instead we look at the average hourly wage breakdown by age demographic. 

#### 4.3 Male and Female Wage by education level

```{r echo=FALSE}
age_edu_count <- df %>% filter(
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS_AND_ALL,
  `Age group` == "15 years and over",
  YEAR == 2019,
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  Wages == "Average hourly wage rate",
  `Geography` == "Canada"
) %>%
  select(`Education level`, Male, Female) %>%
  mutate(`Wage Difference` = Male - Female) %>%
  rename(
    `Average Hourly Male Wage` = Male,
    `Average Hourly Female Wage` = Female
  ) 
  
age_edu_count %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

This table tracks the hourly wage of Males and Females respectively. It also shows how education levels affect the discrepancy. This table also shows the difference between Male and Female hourly wages.

## 5 Graphs 

#### 5.1 Tracking salary by education level over time

```{r echo=FALSE}
by_year = df %>% filter(
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS,
  Wages == "Average hourly wage rate",
  Geography == "Canada",
  `Age group` == "15 years and over"
)

by_year$`Education level` <- factor(by_year$`Education level`, levels = rev(EDUCATION_LEVELS))

ggplot(by_year, aes(
  x = YEAR,
  y = `Both Sexes`,
  color = `Education level`,
)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("Average Hourly Wage by Year") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Average Hourly Wage")
```
This graph shows the hourly wages of each education level from the years 1997-2019.

## 6 Use of confidence interval and test of hypothesis

Let us now test our hypothesis of the paired t-test $$H_0:$$ There is no average difference between Education and Wage vs. $$H_a:$$ There is an average difference between Education and Wage

#### 6.1 Hypothesis Test of Average Hourly Wage

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_hourly = df %>% filter(
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS,
  Wages == "Average hourly wage rate",
  Geography == "Canada"
) %>%
  mutate(
    Education = case_when(
    `Education level` == "0 - 8 years" ~ 1, 
    `Education level` == "Some high school" ~ 2, 
    `Education level` == "High school graduate" ~ 3, 
    `Education level` == "Some post-secondary" ~ 4, 
    `Education level` == "Post-secondary certificate or diploma" ~ 5, 
    `Education level` == "Bachelor's degree" ~ 6, 
    `Education level` == "Above bachelor's degree" ~ 7, 
    )
  )
  
df_hourly %>%
  with(t.test(x=Education, y=`Both Sexes`, paired = TRUE)) 
```

This paired t-test tells us that there is a relationship between Education and Average Hourly Wage. The p-value is very small (much smaller than $\alpha=0.05$) and 0 is not in the 95% confidence interval. Therefore, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis: $H_0:$ mean difference between the two groups is 0.  

#### 6.2 Hypothesis Test of Average Weekly Wage

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_weekly = df %>% filter(
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS,
  Wages == "Average weekly wage rate",
  Geography == "Canada"
) %>%
  mutate(
    Education = case_when(
    `Education level` == "0 - 8 years" ~ 1, 
    `Education level` == "Some high school" ~ 2, 
    `Education level` == "High school graduate" ~ 3, 
    `Education level` == "Some post-secondary" ~ 4, 
    `Education level` == "Post-secondary certificate or diploma" ~ 5, 
    `Education level` == "Bachelor's degree" ~ 6, 
    `Education level` == "Above bachelor's degree" ~ 7, 
    )
  )
  
df_weekly %>%
  with(t.test(x=Education, y=`Both Sexes`, paired = TRUE)) 
```

This paired t-test tells us that there is a relationship between Education and Average Weekly Wage. The p-value is very small (much smaller than $\alpha=0.05$) and 0 is not in the 95% confidence interval. Therefore, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis: $H_0:$ mean difference between the two groups is 0.  

## 7 Use of bootstrapping

Since the data from our dataset is aggregated, we should use bootstrapping to ensure that our hypothesis holds even when there are multiple potential samples. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
hourly_df = df %>% filter(
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS,
  Wages == "Average hourly wage rate",
  YEAR == "2019"
) %>%
  mutate(
    Education = case_when(
    `Education level` == "0 - 8 years" ~ 1, 
    `Education level` == "Some high school" ~ 2, 
    `Education level` == "High school graduate" ~ 3, 
    `Education level` == "Some post-secondary" ~ 4, 
    `Education level` == "Post-secondary certificate or diploma" ~ 5, 
    `Education level` == "Bachelor's degree" ~ 6, 
    `Education level` == "Above bachelor's degree" ~ 7, 
    )
  ) 

set.seed(100)

d = na.omit(as.data.frame(cbind(hourly_df$`Both Sexes`,hourly_df$Education)))
#d
boot_function=function(){
  boot.d = d %>% sample_n(nrow(d), replace=T)
  m2 = lm(V1~V2, data=boot.d)
  s = coef(m2)[2]
  return(s)
}
output = replicate(1000, boot_function())
quantile(output, c(0.025,0.975))
```
0 is outside of this interval, meaning that we can reject the hypothesis: $\beta_2=0$. Meaning, for every increase in education level, there is a non-zero increase in average hourly wage. Therefore, education level has an impact on average hourly wage.

## 8 Regression analysis 

```{r echo=FALSE}
df_hourly = df %>% filter(
  `Type of work` == "Both full- and part-time",
  `Education level` %in% EDUCATION_LEVELS,
  Wages == "Average hourly wage rate",
  Geography == "Canada",
  YEAR == 2019 #so that we don't have to account for inflation
) %>%
  mutate(
    Education = case_when(
    `Education level` == "0 - 8 years" ~ 1, 
    `Education level` == "Some high school" ~ 2, 
    `Education level` == "High school graduate" ~ 3, 
    `Education level` == "Some post-secondary" ~ 4, 
    `Education level` == "Post-secondary certificate or diploma" ~ 5, 
    `Education level` == "Bachelor's degree" ~ 6, 
    `Education level` == "Above bachelor's degree" ~ 7, 
    )
  )

m <- lm(df_hourly$`Both Sexes` ~ df_hourly$Education)
summary(m)
```

From the summary chart, we see that for every one level of increase in education, there is an average of 3.0647 dollar increase in the average hourly wage rate. However, we notice that our R-Squared and adjusted R-Squared values are 0.62 and 0.61 respectively, which means that education level alone can only explain around 62% of variability in hourly wage rate on our filtered dataset. 

## 9 Use of cross validation

```{r}
d=df_hourly %>% mutate(group_ind = sample(c("train","test"),
size=nrow(df_hourly),
prob = c(0.7,0.3),
replace = T))

set.seed(100)
m=lm(d$`Both Sexes`~d$Education, data = d %>% filter(group_ind=="train"), na.rm=T)
#mse for training data set
y.hat = predict(m)
mean((d$`Both Sexes`[d$group_ind=="train"] - y.hat)**2)
y.hat = na.omit(predict(m, newdata = d %>% filter(group_ind=="test")))
mean((d$`Both Sexes`[d$group_ind=="test"] - y.hat)**2)
```

The testing MSE is similar to the training MSE, which means that our model is a decent indicator of the trends in the data. It is slightly higher, which can indicate overfitting, but since it's not higher by much, there isn't too much cause for concern. 

## 10 A final summary of your findings

This table shows a clear trend that more education results in a a higher wage. This comes with an exception, as high school graduates on average have higher wages then those with some post-secondary experience. This table is useful in demonstrating that more education usually leads to higher wages.

Here we see another trend that wages usually increase with age.
